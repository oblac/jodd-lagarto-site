# What is Jodd?

**Jodd** is a set of developer-friendly and open-source Java micro-frameworks. It's designed to make things simple but not simpler. See more[ here](https://jodd.org).

**Lagarto** is still part of the Jodd. However, since it tracked more attention than any other library, it has been moved to a separate repository, starting from version 6.

I hope this will allow **Lagarto** to grow efficiently and, more importantly, I will be able to release it more frequently; without the burden of releasing other components.
