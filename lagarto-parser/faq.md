# FAQ

### What's going on with my TITLE and TEXTAREA?

Those two tags are different. You can close them ONLY with a closing tag.

For example, the following snippet:

```markup
<html><head><title /></head><body>hello world!</body></html>
```

has the 3 tags only: `html`, `body`, and `title`. The text for `title` tag is _everything_ from the `</head` up to the end of the string.
